Test-Driven Development With Python

Software development is easier and more accessible now than it ever has been.
Unfortunately, rapid development speeds offered by modern programming languages make it easy for us as programmers to overlook the possible error conditions in our code and move on to other parts of a project. Automated tests can provide us with a level of certainty that our code really does handle various situations the way we expect it to, and these tests can save hundreds upon thousands of man-hours over the course of a project’s development lifecycle.
Automated testing is a broad topic–there are many different types of automated tests that one might write and use. In this article we’ll be concentrating on unit testing and, to some degree, integration testing using Python 3 and a methodology known as “test-driven development” (referred to as “TDD” from this point forward). Using TDD, you will learn how to spend more time coding than you spend manually testing your code.
To get the most out of this article, you should have a fair understanding of common programming concepts. For starters, you should be familiar with variables, functions, classes, methods, and Python’s import mechanism. We will be using some neat features in Python, such as context managers, decorators, and monkey-patching. You don’t necessarily need to understand the intricacies of these features to use them for testing.
